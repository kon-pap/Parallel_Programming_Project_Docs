# Group-302

This is your teams documentation repository. 
You can find informational material here. 
This is also the place where you should keep your project documentation (such as the slides for the presentation).

You should have access to separate repositories to store code for each of the tasks on your project descriptions (OpenMP, MPI, Hybrid, Bonus).
